# logging-config

More configurable logging for Javascript/Typescript. Maybe it's useful to you, maybe it's not.

This project uses [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to handle multiple node projects in one repository. It's also my first time using the tool, so if there's anything I'm doing wrong, let me know.
